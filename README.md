[Original repo](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk "https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk")

### Deepwalk
> Learns social representations of a graphâ€™s vertices, by modeling a stream of short random walks
* Generalizes neural language model
* Takes graph as input
* Produces a latent representations as an output
